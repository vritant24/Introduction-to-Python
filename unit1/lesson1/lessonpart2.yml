title: ðŸ’¡ What is "Computer Science
content: "Computer Science is not really about computers, and it is not really a
  science. Instead, Computer Science is more about solving problems. Although we
  use many tools, Computer Scientists' most common tool is Programming.\r

  ## What is \"Programming\"?\r

  \r

  A program is a series of concrete instructions that can be carried out by a
  computer. A program can be thought of as a script for a play that will be
  performed by actors who follow instructions perfectly but without any
  intelligence of their own.\r

  \r

  Programs are sometimes also called:\r

  \r

  -   \"Software\"\r

  -   \"Applications\"\r

  -   \"Code\"\r

  -   \"Scripts\"\r

  \r

  There are many kinds of programs that you use every day - your web browser,
  your music player, and even video games. Programs can be run on laptops,
  phones, cars - almost everything runs programs now.\r

  \r

  Programming now shows up in every field, from engineering to the sciences to
  even the arts and humanities. Regardless of whether you want to be a computer
  scientist or just someone who knows a bit about programming, this is a skill
  that will come in handy.\r

  \r

  You might think that some of the things that computers do are mysterious, but
  everything they do is the result of very careful instructions. Although
  programming is very powerful, computers are not gods. In fact, programs can
  only do what people have told them to do. You must be very clear and explicit
  when writing programs.\r

  \r

  Fundamentally, a program takes some representation of the world, manipulates
  it by following instructions, and then presents the results to the user. This
  core idea of translating between reality and digital data is the very heart of
  what we do.\r

  \r

  ## What is a Programming Language?\r

  \r

  Programs are created by writing instructions in a _programming language_, like
  how movie scripts are written in human spoken languages like English.
  Programming languages were created by computer scientists, to make it easy to
  write instructions that a computer can understand. A computer can then run
  these programs - if they are written correctly.\r

  > [!TIP]\r

  > Your First Check Your Understanding Question\r

  > As a reminder, _Check Your Understanding_ questions are like the quizzes you
  take in your classroom. They help you remember, understand, and apply what
  you've learned in the lesson. In this course, if you answer a question
  incorrectly, you'll get hints to help you find the right answer.\r\n"
