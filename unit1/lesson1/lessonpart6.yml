title: "⌨️ Code Challenge: Run a Python Program"
content: "> [!TIP]\r

  > Woah! What just happened?\r

  > Welcome to a _Code Challenge_! An editor has appeared on the right side of
  the screen. This is where you will write your code for each Challenge. You can
  run your code by selecting the green \"Run\" button - a sideways triangle -
  above the editor. The output of your code will appear in the Terminal below
  the editor.\r

  \r

  ## Write & Run a Python Program\r

  \r

  The goal of this Challenge is to write a short program in Python that prints
  out the phrase \"Hello world!\" to the screen. When you see the message
  appear, you’ll have executed a Python program and successfully completed this
  Challenge!\r

  \r

  ### Instructions\r

  \r

  1.  Locate the editor in the right-hand side of the screen.\r

  \r

  > [!NOTE] > \\# in your code file?\r

  > When you use a \\# at the beginning or end of a code line, Python interprets
  this as a comment. If you place a comment at the end of a line, remember that
  Python will ignore the rest of the line. Python comments are notes or
  explanations that you can write within your code to help you and others
  understand what the code is doing. They are like little reminders or messages
  that you leave for yourself or others who read your code.\r

  \r

  2.  Type the following code into the file below the comment line:\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  print(\"Hello world!\")\r

  ```\r

  \r

  3.  Click the green \"Run\" button (the green triangle) above the editor to
  print the result of running the code in your Terminal.\r

  4.  Observe the output, which should be the phrase \"Hello world!\" printed to
  the screen.\r

  \r

  ### Tips and Hints\r

  \r

  -   Make sure to include the parentheses around the text \"Hello world!\" in
  the print statement.\r

  -   Be careful with spelling, capitalization, and punctuation in your code.\r

  \r

  ### Extend Your Learning\r

  \r

  Using the same `print` call, try creating additional statements in the Editor
  and checking the output in the Terminal.\r\n"
