title: ðŸ’¡ Executing a Program
content: >
  Once a program is written according to the Python language rules, the program
  can be executed. This means that the computer will read the text of the
  program line by line and perform each step. This is just like following the
  steps of a recipe or instructions; just like a human, the computer will do
  each step one at a time.


  ## Terminology


  When we want to use a program, we will say the program is "run" or "executed."
  Either a program will end on its own, or we will have to stop it ourselves,
  which is sometimes referred to as "killing" a program.


  * **Run**: Perform each step of a program line by line


  * **Execute**: Synonym for "run"


  * **Kill**: To stop a program


  ## Programming Environments


  One way to write programs is to use a text editor and then run them with
  Python on its own. But, most programmers prefer a _programming environment_
  (like this one) that simplifies writing programs and lets you run them with
  just one click. Usually, when you run a program, you see some visual output,
  but this is not always the case.


  A programming environment is a software tool that helps you make programs. It
  has three parts: an editor, an interpreter, and a console. The editor is where
  you write your code. The interpreter is what runs your code. The console is
  where you see what your code does. A good programming environment can also
  help you with coding features like colors, suggestions, and error checking.


  Letâ€™s write a simple program now and see how it works!
