title: ðŸ’¡ Python
content: "In this course, you are learning a programming language named Python.
  However, there are many programming languages out there. You might be
  wondering why Python is a good language to learn if there are so many
  options.\r

  \r

  First, Python is one of the most popular languages in the world; in fact,
  according to some metrics, it might be THE most popular programming language
  in the world. Second, it has a huge number of libraries that make it useful
  for a wide range of problems in scientific computing, data science, web
  development, and much more. Third, it is sometimes called a \"friendly\"
  language for beginners, because many people have found it easier to learn than
  other languages despite being so powerful.\r

  \r

  > [!TIP]\r

  > What are libraries?\r

  > Libraries in Python are like treasure chests full of useful tools and
  functions that make your programming life easier. They are pre-written code
  collections created by other programmers to solve common problems or provide
  extra functionality. Instead of starting from scratch and writing everything
  yourself, you can use these libraries to save time and effort.\r

  >\r

  > Imagine you want to prepare a delicious meal, but you don't have all the
  ingredients and tools necessary. Instead of making everything from scratch,
  you can rely on a variety of pre-packaged ingredients and kitchen gadgets.
  Python libraries work in a similar way. They provide you with ready-made
  ingredients (functions and tools) that you can use to cook up amazing programs
  without starting from scratch.\r

  ## Python is a Language and a Tool\r

  \r

  Python is two things:\r

  \r

  1. Python is a **programming language**.\r

  2. Python is a **tool that runs programs**.\r

  \r

  First, as a programming language, Python is a set of rules for writing Python
  programs. Second, Python is also a program that can execute programs written
  according to the rules of the Python programming language. Therefore, we will
  sometimes refer to Python as a language, and sometimes refer to Python as a
  tool for running programs. Before we explain what it means to run a program,
  let us talk about programming languages a little more.\r\n"
