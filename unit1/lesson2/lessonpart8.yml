title: ðŸ’¡ Input
content: "The `input` function lets you get information from users. The code
  below demonstrates incorporating the `input` function along with `print`:


  ```python

  favorite_color = input(\"What is your favorite color?\")\r

  print(\"Your favorite color is\", favorite_color)


  ```


  > \\[!NOTE]

  > Gathering Input From Your Users

  > Try running this program by copying it to your editor. Notice that once
  again there is text between parentheses asking for their favorite color. That
  text will be shown as a prompt to the user in the console. The user will be
  able to type their answer and press Enter. On the second line, we used the
  `print` function to print out that same information. Without that `print`,
  this program would only ask the user for their color, without ever reporting
  anything back at the end. While not a very big program, this is a
  demonstration of the input-processing-output workflow that every program will
  have.
