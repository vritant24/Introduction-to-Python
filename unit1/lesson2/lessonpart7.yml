content: "Now try writing your own Python program from scratch. Use the `print`
  function to display the phrase:\r

  \r

  `This is programming!`\r

  \r

  and symbols! Here is a reminder of how `print` functions look:\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  print(\"This text will be shown to the user!\")\r

  ```\r\n"
