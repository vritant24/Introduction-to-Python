title: Code
content: "Computers take in data from users and put out results. To transform
  the inputs into the outputs, we write instructions as code. The instructions
  that we write are often stored in a program, so that they can be reused. This
  is what \"programs\" or \"code\" really are. Now let's learn how to write a
  very simple program by learning two basic commands (which we will also call
  \"functions\"):\r

  \r

  -   **`input`**: A function to get data from the user\r

  -   **`print`**: A function to report data to the user\r

  \r

  Let's look at what these commands look like in our very first, simple
  programs.\r\n"
