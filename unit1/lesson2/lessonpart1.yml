title: Introduction
content: "## Overview\r

  \r

  In this section, you will learn how your programs can interact with the user.
  We’ll begin by explaining the basic phases of program execution: taking input,
  processing the data, and then presenting output. Then we’ll explain how the
  _terminal_, also known as a _console_, is one place where that input and
  output can occur. We use the Python `input` and `print` functions to interact
  with the terminal from our programs.\r
