  ## Overview


  In this section, you will learn how your programs can interact with the user.
  We’ll begin by explaining the basic phases of program execution: taking input,
  processing the data, and then presenting output. Then we’ll explain how the
  _terminal_, also known as a _console_, is one place where that input and
  output can occur. We use the Python `input` and `print` functions to interact
  with the terminal from our programs.


  ## Learning Objectives


  Upon completion of this lesson, you'll be able to:


  * Explain the steps of program execution.

  * Give examples of input and output for programs.

  * Write basic python code using print and input to interact with the user.

  * Explain how programs fundamentally work by transforming data.


  ## Standards


  Targeted standards for this unit include:


  * 1A-AP-08, K-2: Model daily processes by creating and following algorithms
  (sets of step-by-step instructions) to complete tasks.
