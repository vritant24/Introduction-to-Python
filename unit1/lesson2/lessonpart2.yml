  ## Phases of a Program


  Every program has three main phasfsdfes. First, input data is given to the
  program. Second, the data is processed. Third, the data is output in some way
  to the user. _Inputs_ and _Outputs_ are how we connect programs to the real
  world.


  Think of it like baking. The inputs are your ingredients. Mixing and stirring
  are the processing. Then, the cake is your output.


  ## Input


  Examples of input are data typed by a keyboard, movements made by your mouse,
  data from the internet, and data from sensors.


  ## Processing


  Examples of processing are operations that do math, manipulate text, and make
  logical queries.


  ## Output


  Examples of output are pixels on your screen, sound from your speakers, paper
  out of your printer, or the movement of a robotic arm.
