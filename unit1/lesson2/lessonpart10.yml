  -   Every program can be broken down into the stages of taking input,
  processing the data, and then presenting output.\r

  -   The terminal, also known as a console, is one of the simplest places for
  the input and output to occur.\r

  -   In Python, we use the `input` and `print` functions to interact with the
  terminal from our programs.\r

  -   Eventually, we will build much more sophisticated programs that have other
  ways of interacting with the user.\r
