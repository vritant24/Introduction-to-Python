title: The Goal of Programs
content: "The goal of any program is to transform the input data into the
  desired outputs. For now, our programs will have simple inputs and simple
  outputs that work through the terminal. But eventually, we will create complex
  code that can achieve great things. For example, you could have the user speak
  into a microphone, with their instructions translated into the movement of a
  robot. Or, have the user input recent weather data in order to create the
  output of future weather predictions.\r

  \r

  Remember: The goal of almost any program is to process input data into the
  appropriate output on behalf of a user. You should always think about your
  programs in terms of how they help a user achieve some goal. Keeping humans at
  the center of the development process is often essential to making software
  that helps people.\r\n"
