title: Lesson 2 - User Interaction
description: "In this section, you will learn how their programs can interact
  with the user. It begins with explaining the basic phases of program
  execution: taking input, processing the data, and then presenting output. Then
  it explains how the terminal, also known as a console, is one place where that
  input and output can occur. We use the Python `input` and `print` functions to
  interact with the terminal from our programs."

        - Write basic python code using print and input to interact with the user.
        - Explain how programs fundamentally work by transforming data.
