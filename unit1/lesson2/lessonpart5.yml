  The code in your Editor currently prints the message `"Hello world."` Let's
  change it to print something different. Update the code so that it prints
  `"Python is great!"` instead.


  ```python

  print("Python is great!")

  ```


  Try running the code after making the change to see the new message displayed
  in the terminal.


  Reddit is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion
  website. Registered members can submit content to the site such as links, text
  posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are
  organized by subject into user-created boards called "subreddits," which cover
  a wide range of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music,
  books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Reddit's structure allows for a
  diverse range of discussions and community interactions.
