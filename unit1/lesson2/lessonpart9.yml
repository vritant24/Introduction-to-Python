title: "⌨️ Code Challenge: Print Input"
content: "Let’s try writing one more program. The goal of this code challenge is
  to ask the user for their favorite animal, and then print out the animal in
  the terminal.\r

  \r

  > [!TIP]\r

  > Code Challenge Tip\r

  > You will need to **incorporate the `input` function _in_ the `print`
  function**.\r

  \r

  Remember, we will not write the name of the animal in our program - you should
  use the `input` function to prompt the user for the name of the animal, and
  then print out the result.\r

  \r

  When you run the program, you will need to type your answer into the terminal
  to have the program finish running.\r

  \r

  Here is an example of how we could ask the user for their favorite color. You
  can use this as a starting point for your program but will need to make
  changes to meet the requirements of the challenge:\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  favorite_color = input(\"What is your favorite color?\")\r

  print(\"Your favorite color is\", favorite_color)\r

  ```\r\n"
