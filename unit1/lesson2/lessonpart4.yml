title: ðŸ’¡ Print
content: "The `print` function lets you write information to users. Printing is
  necessary because we cannot see \"inside\" the mind of the computer when a
  program runs. For now, the only thing we end up seeing is the result of
  whatever we print. Notice that there is some text between the parentheses:
  this is the text that is output to the user.\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  print(\"This text will be shown to the user.\")\r

  ```\r

  \r

  > [!NOTE]\r

  > Printing Your Code\r

  > Try running this program by copying it to your editor. Run the code and
  verify the message that \"printed\" on the console. You can think of the
  console as like a messenger box, for sending and receiving data to and from
  the computer. Every time you run this program, the exact same text will be
  written in the console by the computer.\r\n"
