title: Summary
content: "-   There are two essential parts to calling a function: the name of
  the function and parentheses.\r

  -   Parentheses are absolutely essential to calling a function.\r

  -   Usually, when you call a function, you also pass in arguments to the
  function by putting them between the parentheses, so that the function can
  manipulate the arguments.\r

  -   Functions return a value when they are finished being evaluated, which is
  substituted in just like an operation.\r

  -   Methods are a special kind of function where the first argument’s value is
  placed BEFORE the name of the function along with a period.\r

  -   Functions are essentially smaller versions of programs made for a single
  specific task.\r

  -   Programs are usually composed of many function calls.\r

  -   Functions can be treated like an opaque box that you cannot see inside of
  that transforms values for you; even if you do not know how that box works,
  you can still use the box to get things done.\r
