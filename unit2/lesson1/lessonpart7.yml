title: Magic Function Box
content: Think of a function as a magic box full of machinery. You may not be
  able to see inside the box to know how it works, but you do not need to.
  Arguments are the knobs and dials on the outside of the box that let you
  control its inner workings. Returned values are like a slot that dispenses the
  results of the function.
