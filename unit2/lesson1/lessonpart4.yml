title: Delegation of Work
content: "You don't have to know how a function accomplishes its goal to use it.
  Think of it like a well-run office. When you ask a co-worker to complete some
  work, you don't care how it happens â€” just the inputs and outputs to their
  process. This separation of concerns allows you to focus on pieces of a
  program without worrying about the whole thing.\r\n"
