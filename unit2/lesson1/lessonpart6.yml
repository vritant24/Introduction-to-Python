title: Returning Values
content: "Function calls return values, just like operations. Functions can
  return any type of value: string, Boolean, integer, whatever. Mentally, when a
  function is called, you can imagine the result replacing the entire function
  call. In a way, this is like what happens when you do addition or
  subtraction.\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  # call function, result is returned and assigned\r

  new_value = round(3.9)\r

  \r

  # Can use print it, update it, etc.\r

  print(new_value)\r

  new_value += 1\r

  print(new_value)\r

  ```\r\n"
