title: ðŸ’¡ Arguments
content: "One of the most useful features of functions is _arguments_. Arguments
  are values that are given to functions that affect the behavior of the
  function. Arguments for a function are placed inside the parentheses, and each
  one is separated by a comma. We say that these arguments are being \"passed\"
  to the function.\r

  \r

  ```python\r

  # One argument\r

  round(4.3)\r

  \r

  # Three arguments\r

  print(\"First\", \"Second\", \"Third\")\r

  \r

  # Zero arguments - prints a blank line\r

  print()\r

  ```\r

  \r

  Function calls do not always require arguments. The last example above shows
  how the `print` function doesnâ€™t need to take any arguments; the function will
  still print, but only an empty line. The number of arguments depends on the
  function and what you want to do with the function. Some functions take one
  argument all the time, some take multiple arguments sometimes, and everything
  in between.\r\n"
