title: ðŸ’¡ Functions vs. Methods
content: "Methods are a special kind of function. They are attached strongly to
  a value. The way we write a method call is slightly different, too, since it
  needs to incorporate that value. When you want to use a _method_, you need the
  name, parentheses, AND two more pieces: the calling value or variable and a
  period. In later lessons, we'll learn more about this strange syntax. For now,
  get comfortable with the difference between calling functions and methods.\r

  ```python\r

  message = \"MAKE THIS LOWERCASE\"\r

  \r

  # Call the `lower` method\r

  message = message.lower()\r

  print(message)\r
